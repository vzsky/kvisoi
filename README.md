# KVISOI

A simple web application that judges codes, made for KVIS Olympiad in Informatics Club.

## Instruction

### To run the program

  1. Download **ONLY** the deploy_env directory 
  2. Edit the docker-compose.yml file, correct the site configuration
  4. Deploy using `docker-compose up`
  5. Run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate` in the docker shell (if needed)
### To add Tasks
  1. Access the admin page and add new task object
  2. Upload the task input and output to the /grader_config/tasks/<task_id>
  3. Don't forget the manifest.json
### To access admin page
  1. Create new superuser by `python manage.py createsuperuser`
  2. Access /admin and login

### To contribute

1. Fork this project and make a PR!

## Concerns

### API route is not blocked
  - Anyone can send request to certain endpoint to fake judge result
  - To be fix by restricting those endpoints from external access
    - Traefik can handle this (waiting for the next update for a neat implementation)

## Things to be improved

- Templates obviously (responsive will be appreciated)
- Use websocket to update submission
- Write tests
- Table pagination and search
- Ability to rejudge (for admin)
- Contest management ?
- Better profile page
- Some kind of automation in adding a task
- Add subission timestamp (cause why not)
- Docker Mount `local_settings`
